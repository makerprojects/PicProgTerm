## PicProgTerm
### Terminal based UI for ArdPicProg 

If you would search the internet you will find quite some DIY pic programmers. However, those designs often either require a true seriell or parallel port instead of an easily available USB port or are designed around a pre-programmed controller assuming access to a programmer.</div>
	
A compelling alternative would be the use of an Arduino as in the <a href="http://rweather.github.io/ardpicprog/">ArdPicProg</a>. Load the Arduino sketch, the host program and add a prototype shield with a very limited number of additional components to build your pic programmer. This programmer features also a ICD connector and an RJ-11 jack (ICD2) interface. The complete project including hard- and software is open source and is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html">GNU General Public License Version 3</a>. You can build your own ArdPicProg by using the available kit or especially designed PCB. 

The complete setup and the application of the ArdPicProg is described in more detail on <a href="http://www.pikoder.com/ArdPicProgEN.htm">www.pikoder.com</a>. This page also features a comprehensive <a href="http://www.pikoder.com/download/ArdPicProg User Guide.pdf">User's Guide</a>. 

One element of the ArdPicProg - tool chain is a host software. You can select between two options: the terminal program "PicProgTerm" or the "ArdPicProgHost" application for Windows 7  with a graphical user interface. The source code for both programs can be found in respective repositories on github/makerprojects.
